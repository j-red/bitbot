## BITBOT GUI

------------------

A simple bit-distortion program for randomly overriding different segments of data from any given byte stream. Works particularly well for images.

### TODO:

* Need to implement the 'Attempt Photo Fix' functionality
* Fine-tune bit distortion algorithm with other, more interesting methods
* Address other various graphical bugs

#### venv setup:

On Windows, run `call Scripts/activate` from the `/bitbot/` directory.
